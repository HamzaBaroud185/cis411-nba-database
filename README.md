# NBA Relational Database System

## Overview
This project involved the design and implementation of a relational database system to analyze National Basketball Association (NBA) data, including teams, players, coaches, leagues, and performance statistics.

The database supports multi-table analytical queries to evaluate player and team performance and demonstrates core database design principles.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL
- Microsoft Access
- Relational Database Design
- Entity-Relationship Modeling
- Data Normalization (3NF)

## Database Design
- Designed ER diagrams and converted them into normalized relational schemas
- Implemented primary and foreign key constraints across all tables
- Modeled one-to-many and many-to-many relationships

## Key Queries & Analysis
- Retrieved player and coach data across teams and conferences
- Analyzed points per game, games played, and three-point statistics
- Executed complex queries across 2–5 tables using joins, grouping, and aggregations
